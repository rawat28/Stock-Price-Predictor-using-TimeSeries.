# Stock-Price-Predictor-using-TimeSeries.
# Stock Price Predictor Using Time Series Analysis

Overview

This project implements a stock price prediction model using Time Series Analysis, particularly the ARIMA model. By analyzing historical stock data, we aim to forecast future stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation, ultimately delivering a reliable predictive framework.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and preparing the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of stock price trends to understand data patterns and distributions.
Feature Engineering: Generation of additional features like moving averages and percentage changes to enhance the model.
Time Series Modeling: Using the ARIMA model for forecasting future stock prices based on historical data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Project Structure

- The dataset containing historical stock prices (Date, Close, Open, High, Low, etc.).
- `main.py`: The main Python script that implements data preprocessing, feature engineering, ARIMA model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `statsmodels`: For time series modeling (ARIMA).
- `scikit-learn`: For additional machine learning tools (if needed).

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
```

How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rawat28/Stock-Price-Predictor-using-TimeSeries.git
   cd stock-price-predictor-using-TimeSeries
   ```

2. Add the Data:
   I have added the dataset file in CSV format. if you want to add your data set than ensure it includes a `Date` column and a `Close` price column at a minimum.

3. Run the Script:

   Execute the main Python script to preprocess the data, train the ARIMA model, and visualize the results:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Results:
   The script will output model performance metrics and plot the stock price trends, along with the predicted prices.

Results

The model generates predictions for future stock prices based on historical data. Key results include performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and visualizations comparing actual stock prices with predicted values.

Future Enhancements

- Incorporation of external factors (news, economic data) for improved accuracy.
- Exploration of deep learning techniques like LSTMs for more complex time series patterns.
- Real-time stock price predictions by integrating live data.
